%description
psgrep started as a small shell script to automate the process of doing "ps aux | grep $foo" and to clean up the output since I didn't really care to search for my execution of "grep $foo" along with anything that contained "$foo".
psgrep has come a little ways since then (four releases) and has even had a man page written for it! psgrep is free software and is licensed under the GNU GPL version 3 (or any later version).
